### Transitions to Sustainable Urban Mobility in Sub-Saharan Africa

T-SUM is an interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaborative project that aims to identify the conditions under which pathways to sustainable and inclusive transport and land use development can be accelerated in growing cities in the Global South.

T-SUM is grounded in the observation that, in the context of still-low-but-rising levels of motorization, economic growth and increasing social and spatial inequalities, the formulation and implementation of policies, practices and partnerships that can support an accelerated implementation of sustainable mobility structures is an urgent concern for rapidly developing cities.
